//2.3. Task 3: Demonstrate Type Conversion (Typecasting)
//? Write a program that:
//? Takes a float input from the user and converts it to an integer.
//? Demonstrates ASCII conversion by adding a character (e.g., `'A'`) to an
//integer and printing the result.
//Example Output:
//Enter a float value: 3.14
//After converting to int: 3
//Character 'A' + 5 = F (ASCII Value: 7 )
